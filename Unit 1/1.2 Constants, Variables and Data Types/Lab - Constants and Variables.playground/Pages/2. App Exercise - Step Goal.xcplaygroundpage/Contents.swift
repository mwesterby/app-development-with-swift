 ## App Exercise - Step Goal
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Your fitness tracking app needs to know goal number of steps per day. Create a constant `goalSteps` and set it to 10000.

/*:
 Use two `print` functions to print two separate lines to the console. The first line should say "Your step goal for the day is:", and the second line should print the value of `goalSteps` by referencing your constant.
