 ## App Exercise - Step Count
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
Create a variable called `steps` that will keep track of the number of steps you take throughout the day. Set its initial value to 0 to represent the step count first thing in the morning. Print `steps` to the console.

/*:
 Now assume the tracker has been keeping track of steps all morning, and you want to show the user the latest step count. Update `steps` to be 2000. Print `steps` to the console. Then print "Good job! You're well on your way to your daily goal."
 */
