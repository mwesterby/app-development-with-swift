 ## App Exercise - Swimming Workouts
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Previous app exercises have introduced the idea that your fitness tracking app may allow users to track swimming workouts. Create a `SwimmingWorkout` struct below with properties for `distance`, `time`, and `stroke`. `distance` and `time` should be of type `Double` and will represent distance in meters and time in seconds, and `stroke` should be of type `String`.
 */


/*:
 Allowing `stroke` to be of type `String` isn't very type-safe. Inside the `SwimmingWorkout` struct, create an enum called `Stroke` that has cases for `freestyle`, `butterfly`, `backstroke`, and `breaststroke`. Change the type of `stroke` from `String` to `Stroke`. Create two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` objects.
 */


/*:
 Now imagine you want to log swimming workouts separately based on the swimming stroke. You might use arrays as static variables on `SwimmingWorkout` for this. Add four static variables, `freestyleWorkouts`, `butterflyWorkouts`, `backstrokeWorkouts`, and `breaststrokeWorkouts`, to `SwimmingWorkout` above. Each should be of type `[SwimmingWorkout]` and should default to empty arrays.
 */


/*:
 Now add an instance method to `SwimmingWorkout` called `save` that takes no parameters and has no return value. This method will add its instance to the static array on `SwimmingWorkout` that corresponds to its swimming stroke. Inside `save` write a switch statement that switches on the instance's `stroke` property, and appends `self` to the proper array. Call save on the two instances of `SwimmingWorkout` that you created above, and then print the array(s) to which they should have been added to see if your `save` method works properly.
